        <p>
          Fatal incidents involving law enforcement officers in the United
          States are a significant concern. Congress requested data on police
          use of force in 1994, but it was never compiled, and the FBI doesn't
          collect this information. Recent estimates indicate an annual range of
          930 to 1,240 justifiable homicides, with police shootings being a
          leading cause of death for men aged 25‚Äì29. Two databases,
          <span class="custom-highlight">'The Counted'</span> by The Guardian
          and <span class="custom-highlight">The Washington Post</span>,
          recorded these incidents from 2015 to 2019. In 2019, The Washington
          Post reported 1,004 police shooting fatalities, totaling 6,600 since
          2015, primarily affecting men.

          Our website will visualize data from the

          database. We'll explore case distribution by state, identify cities
          with the highest incidence, analyze age and race demographics, assess
          weapons used, and present an annual case trend.

          The analysis reveals a stark disparity in the frequency of these
          incidents, with
          <span class="custom-highlight">California</span> bearing the brunt at
          a staggering <span class="custom-highlight">739</span> occurrences,
          followed by Texas at 439. Meanwhile,
          <span class="custom-highlight">Rhode Island</span> stands in stark
          contrast, experiencing a mere
          <span class="custom-highlight">2</span> such incidents ‚Äì a stark
          reminder of the dramatic differences across states.
